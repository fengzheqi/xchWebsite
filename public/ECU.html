    <p><a href="http://www.ecufilmfestival.com/" target="_blank">ÉCU – The European Independent Film Festival</a> is dedicated to the discovery and advancement 
of the very best independent filmmakers from around the world. ÉCU provides a unique platform 
for risk-taking storytellers to reach the broadest audiences possible. It is held annually. 
  </p>
    <p>The 11th edition of ÉCU was held in Paris on 8th ~ 10th April 2016. As a volunteer, I designed a mobile App for the festival which enabled audiences to get information easily and conveniently. Also as a staff, I maintained the order of ÉCU on-site.</p>

I designed the application interface and used

it on-line available for desktop browser, Android
iOS and other mobile devices.

    <h3 style="color:black;">What I learned</h3>   
    <p>Except two fomal staffs (a president and a manager), the others who work in the ÉCU team are volunteers. Most of them are students and enthusiastic about movies. We have around 15 people each year to prepare for the film festival. Some people work longer in the team while some just work in a short period. All of us did make contributions to the film festival together.  
When I worked in the team, I met many new friends from different countries. Even though it was a short stay which just lasted one month, It was a memorial and fun experience. <b>I learned how to get familiar with a new organization in a short time and get into my role quickly and efficiently. Thanks to this experience, my communication skills have been improved. I was not shy any more to talk to new people and I would like to ask questions bravely. </b>
