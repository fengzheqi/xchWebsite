    <p> As a graphic design intern, my responsibility was to design posters, brochures, business card, various exhibition boards which were used in this exhibition. Because of the company's rules, I was not allowed to show the original design draft/pictures. The pictures above display the different printed materials I designed in this exhibition.   </p>

    <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <br/>
        <p> It was the first time for me to work in a big company as a graphic design intern. <b>The basic graphic software skills</b>, such as Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe InDesign, <b>practiced a lot during this intern period</b>. Considering the company branding, the graphic design work is different from the design projects in school. Because the primary/secondary color, font family/size, design style were already defined within the company. <b>I learned how to optimized the creative space when also sticked to the branding design rules which were defined by the company.</b> Thanks a lot to my mentor, XiaoLi Zhu, she did taught me many useful and practical design skills in the industry.    </p>
