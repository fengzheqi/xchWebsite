    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The goal of this project was to awake the relationship between 
people and concrete in China. This is a team work project(Team work with Yiqun Huang, Yong Dai). We started from concrete research, 
and tried to compare people’s emotion about concrete historically.
Finally, we proposed design concept about concret design.</p>

     <h3 > Concrete Development Research  </h3>
    <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6">
       
          <p>We did a research about the development of concrete
in China. Concrete was used to be applied to 
architecture. Concrete exited in China as early as 3000
~5000 BC. But there were two gaps in concrete 
development. Because of the historical reasons, the 
gaps happened in1900 and 1950. We did not continue 
our traditional culture of concrete instead of accepting 
western culture of concrete application.  </p>

<h3> Concrete Application in Architecture </h3>
<p>We compared concrete construction of Japan, Spain and China. We chose masterpieces of Tadao Ando 
and Gaudi who were famous architects from Japan and Spain. Their works inherited traditional culture 
successfully while created new modern architecture. But architecture in China now was totally new and 
did not inherit traditional culture. Cities in China looked almost the same and did not have any feature. 
By comparing to Japan and Spain, we tried to explore why we did not inherit our traditional culture and 
what we can do for the current situation of concrete application in China.

        <h3>Design Concept</h3>
        <p>• Concrete Home Furnishing. <br/>
• Reflect the beauty of Concrete. <br/>
• Shorten the distane between concrete and people.<br/>
• Awaken people's memory and intimacy for concrete.</p>
